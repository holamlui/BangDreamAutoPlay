# BangDreamAutoPlay
The development and maintanence of this project is stopped until further notice, welcome for people who are interested to take up this project

<mark>Please read this coner first:</mark>

As I opened this repo from private to public, I see someone who are intrested in this project, either starred/forked this repo. 

So I think I should better describe what the scripts do: All it does is to automize the looping of entering room to keep playing the game, it DOES NOT auto tap the nodes of the song. 

To acheive full combo / all perfect, you'll need a modified apk. You can search for the modified apk online or edit the apk by yourself (need advanced skills).

Caution! Use at your own risk!

One of my account got banned after a bandbattle (pvp) event, I assume that was due to other players' reporting my acc because my sub account just played a small number of matches in the event didn't got banned.
