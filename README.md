# BangDreamAutoPlay
The development and maintanence of this project is stopped until further notice, welcome for people who are interested to take up this project

<mark>Please read this section first:</mark>

As I opened this repo from private to public, I saw someone who are intrested in this project, either starred/forked this repo. 

So I think I should better describe what the scripts do: All it does is to automatically re-enter the room and keep playing the game, it DOES NOT auto tap the nodes of the song. 

To acheive full combo / all perfect, you need a modified apk. You can search for the modified apk online or edit the apk by yourself (need advanced skills).

Caution! Use at your own risk!

My main account got banned after a bandbattle (pvp) event, while my sub account just played a small number of matches in the event didn't got banned.
